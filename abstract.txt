For the Linux kernel, CVEs do not work at all given the rate of fixes
being applied and rapidly backported and pushed to users through a huge
variety of different ways. The average “request to fix” date for Linux
CVEs is -100 days, showing that either no one cares about CVEs for
Linux, or engineers are using them to game their internal release
processes, or no one happens to notice when the kernel developers
resolve an issue, or all of the above. This talk will go into the
problems with CVEs when it comes to a fast moving project like Linux,
and show the decentralized solution that we have been using for the past
14 years instead. All other open source projects are encouraged to use
these same methods to help resolve the problems that CVEs have.
