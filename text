Rough draft of things this talk should be about.
What I used to create the "real" talk, as it's now done, no need to look
at this except to see some rough ideas.
######################################################

Intro
	what cve is
	why created
	NVD
	CNNVD

Problems with CVEs
	long list
	break down a few

How the kernel and CVEs are handled

What to do:
	- ignore CVEs
		- easy, we are doing this today
		- doesn't solve anything
	- burn it down
		- 22 cve requests a day
		- have funding to do so
		- MITRE said "bring it on!"
		- end-game???
	- create something new

Something "new" requirements
	- distributed
	- unique id
	- able to be "revised" over time
	- searchable
	- public

kernel git id
	- all of the above, just needs marketing

	Linux Git Kernel Id (LGKI)?
	Linux Kernel Id (LKI)?
	Kernel Git Id (KGI)?
	Git Kernel Id (GKI)?
	Git Kernel Hash (GKH)?


CVEs, problems
	details of problems


CVEs were originally created to solve a real problem

"The bug mentioned on the second paragraph of this website is fixed in this
specific software release"

Allowed fixes to be tracked across products when problems show up in dependancies
- zlib

NVD - National Vulnerability Database
	superset of CVEs
	analisis of CVEs
	gives CVEs a "score"
	searchable database
	slow to update (average time is 33 days after disclosure)

"National" is very US-centric
CNNVD - China's answer to NVD
	faster update than NVD

Does not update with later changes to existing CVEs

Best thing we have for closed source products
	no way to see the source, have to "trust" they got it right

Open source is different.


How the kernel is developed

<diagram I always use...>

Linux security fixes
	- happen at least once a week
	look like any other bugfix
	rarely called out as a security fix
	many bugfixes not known to be security related until years later
	no differentation between bug types
		bug is a bug is a bug
	very few CVEs ever get assigned for kernel security issues

Linux security fixes != CVEs
	small fraction of kernel security fixes get cves
	if you only cherry-pick CVEs you have an insecure system
	some CVEs have follow-on fixes no documented anywhere
	How the kernel security team works

	2006-2018 has 1005 CVEs assigned to the kernel
		41% (414) had a negative "fix date"
		12 never fixed
		Average fix date, -100 days
		Longest fix dates, -3897 and 2348
		88 fixed within 1 week
		standard deviation 405

Linux Longterm kernels fix problems
	bugs are fixed before you realize it
	google security team requsts for Pixel phones in 2018
		92% (201/218) problems were already fixed in an LTS kernel
		no need for cherry-picking at all
		remaining issues were due to out-of-tree code


Problems with CVEs

- Missing or rejected vulnerabilities, leading to incomplete coverage in the NVD;
- Severely delayed assignment of vulnerability identifiers, creating risks for
  downstream parties who remain unaware and likely unprotected from the issue;
- Poorly contextualized descriptions of vulnerabilities, increasing the
  difficulty of mitigation and vulnerability management; Overinflated and/or
  underplayed vulnerability scores, leading to misallocated resources and in
  some cases vulnerability “fatigue.”
- Abuse by developers who claim inflated numbers of vulnerabilities in order to
  pad resumes, creating “false positives.”
- Difficulty in revoking assigned vulnerabilities when they are found to be
  invalid, creating confusion and lack of trust in overall program.
- Abuse by engineers in organizations who see CVE assignments as a way to
  circumvent difficult management procedures preventing them from doing normal
  software upgrades.
- Discomfort with the CVE program because it is managed by a US federal agency.
- Inability to handle ongoing and complex vulnerabilities that require multiple
  fixes across multiple packages over extended periods of time.



CVE-2019-12379
84ecc2f6eb1c ("consolemap: Fix a memory leaking bug in drivers/tty/vt/consolemap.c")
15b3cd8ef46a ("Revert "consolemap: Fix a memory leaking bug in drivers/tty/vt/consolemap.c"")
Now finally *DISPUTED*
